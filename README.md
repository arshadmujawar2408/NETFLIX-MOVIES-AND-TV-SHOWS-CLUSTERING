The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled.   It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

## Conclusion  
Clustering and sentiment analysis were performed on a dataset of customer reviews for the food delivery service Zomato. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the customer's experience and gain insights about their feedback.

The clustering technique was applied to group customers based on their review text, and it was found that the customers were grouped into two clusters: positive and negative. This provided a general understanding of customer satisfaction levels, with the positive cluster indicating the highest level of satisfaction and the negative cluster indicating the lowest level of satisfaction.

Sentiment analysis was then applied to classify the review text as positive or negative. This provided a more detailed understanding of customer feedback and helped to identify specific areas where the service could be improved.

Overall, this analysis provided valuable insights into the customer's experience with Zomato, and it could be used to guide future business decisions and improve the service. Additionally, by combining clustering and sentiment analysis techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of customer feedback was achieved.
